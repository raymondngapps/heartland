    "BANNER_UNDERSTAND_DEATH_CONTENT": "Children's understanding of death differs from that of adults, and their level of acceptance varies as a result. However, when adults<br/>face death, they not only have to deal with their own emotions but also help children understand and accept death. This workshop<br/>aims to help parents, teachers, and relevant professionals understand children's perspectives on life. Using picture books, it assists<br/>children in understanding death and overcoming grief. The workshop analyzes and assists adults in understanding children's mental<br/>health from a clinical psychology perspective, providing simple and practical methods to alleviate and address children's emotional<br/>issues. Each participant will receive one relevant picture book.",

    "BANNER_TRAUMA_INFORMED_PRACTICE_CONTENT": "People who have experienced psychological trauma are often misunderstood as being 'temperamental', 'attention-seeking',<br/>'distracted','forgetful', or even labeled as having 'personality disorders'. However, many trauma survivors find it difficult to talk<br/>about past injuries and exhibit various behavioral reactions. Trauma-Informed Practice has long been valued in the mental health<br/>rehabilitation field abroad, emphasizing patient-centered practices. This approach not only encourages a culture of safety and healing<br/>but also focuses on enhancing the physical and mental health of patients. Through just three short training sessions, it is hoped<br/>that participants will gain a better understanding of the psychological impact of trauma on patients' physical and mental well-being,<br/>as well as their responses. Additionally, participants will learn how to respond to and care for individuals with psychological trauma.",
